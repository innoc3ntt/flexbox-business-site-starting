# flexbox-business-site-starting
## Introduction
This is a simple mockup of an outdoor guiding company to test out my flexbox web design skills and knowledge.

## Future implementations
* Fix ratio of images, losing aspect ratio with changing screen resolution
* Min screen size
* media queries to accomodate banner size, the text is moving off screen, scroll bar developing
* nav bar to stay aligned on the right side
* refactor css, repeated redundant code present, could be neater
